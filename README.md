# C Scripts

This repository contains two C scripts:

1. **hewwowowwd.c**: This script prints "Hello, world!" with a weeb twist.
2. **sizeof.c**: This script shows the sizes of different data types in C (int, float, and char) and tests their limits.

## Usage

To compile and run the scripts, use the following commands:

```sh
gcc hewwowowwd.c -o hewwowowwd
./hewwowowwd

gcc sizeof.c -o sizeof
./sizeof
```

Enjoy exploring the scripts!
